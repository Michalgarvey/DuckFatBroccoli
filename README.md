This is my long awaited blog "Duck Fat Broccoli".  It documents one of my favourite things - eating; but also allows me to utilise and practice my newly acquired skills as a web developer. 

This blog is just my second Ruby on Rails project and I hope it will run better than my first.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
